2026-02-05 22:51:22 [INFO] [worker] 1. Reactions parsed as if they were messages (store emoji as message content)
2026-02-05 22:51:22 [INFO] [worker] 2. Set `is_reaction=True` to prevent Penny from immediately responding
2026-02-05 22:51:22 [INFO] [worker] 3. Thread becomes eligible for FollowupAgent to continue

2026-02-05 22:51:39 [INFO] [worker] Now I'll implement the changes according to the spec. Let me start with updating the database model to add the `is_reaction` field and `external_id` field to `MessageLog`.
2026-02-05 22:51:45 [INFO] [worker] [tool] Edit
2026-02-05 22:51:47 [INFO] [worker] Now I'll update the `log_message` function signature to accept these new fields:

2026-02-05 22:52:37 [INFO] [worker] Now I need to update the `handle_message` method in the base channel to NOT process reactions as normal messages, and instead skip the agent processing. Let me add an abstract method for handling reactions and update the handle_message logic:

2026-02-05 22:53:15 [INFO] [worker] Actually, looking at Signal's structure, reactions come in the `dataMessage` field. Let me update the `DataMessage` model:

2026-02-05 22:54:11 [INFO] [worker] Now I need to write tests for the reaction feature. Let me first look at the existing test file structure:

2026-02-05 22:54:48 [INFO] [worker] [tool] Bash
2026-02-05 22:54:55 [INFO] [worker] I have two errors to fix:

2026-02-05 22:54:57 [INFO] [worker] [tool] Edit
2026-02-05 22:54:59 [INFO] [worker] Now fix the forward reference issue by moving the Reaction class before DataMessage:

2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] The implementation follows the spec exactly - reactions are stored as the emoji content, threads stay alive for followup, and no immediate response is triggered. This is a solid Phase 1 foundation that can be extended later with sentiment analysis and adaptive behavior.
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] Perfect! The work is complete. Let me provide a summary:

2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] ### Implementation Summary
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] 
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] **Database Schema Updates:**
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] - Added `is_reaction` boolean field to `MessageLog` to identify reaction messages
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] - Added `external_id` string field to store platform-specific message IDs (Signal timestamps or Discord message IDs)
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] - Added helper methods `find_message_by_external_id()` and `set_external_id()`
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] 
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] **Core Functionality:**
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] - Reactions are logged as lightweight incoming messages with `is_reaction=True`
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] - Reactions keep threads alive for FollowupAgent without triggering immediate responses
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] - Platform-agnostic design in the base `MessageChannel` class
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] 
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] **Signal Integration:**
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] - Added Pydantic models for Signal reactions (`Reaction`, `ReactionEmoji`)
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] - Updated `SignalChannel.extract_message()` to detect and parse reactions
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] - Signal timestamp used as external_id for reaction lookup
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] 
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] **Discord Integration:**
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] - Added `on_reaction_add` event handler
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] - Enabled reactions intent
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] - Discord message ID used as external_id for reaction lookup
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] 
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] **Testing:**
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] - All existing tests pass ✅
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] - New integration test verifies the complete reaction flow ✅
2026-02-05 22:56:19 [INFO] [worker] - Mock Signal server extended with `push_reaction()` method
