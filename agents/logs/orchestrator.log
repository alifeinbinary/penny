2026-02-05 22:17:18 [INFO] [product-manager] All `idea` issues have been processed (there are none). The one `draft` issue (#11) is awaiting user feedback, and I should not take action until the user responds. The backlog issues are intentionally waiting for user to promote them to `idea` status.

2026-02-05 22:17:18 [INFO] [product-manager] - Comments on issue #11 with feedback → I'll respond with an updated spec
2026-02-05 22:17:18 [INFO] [product-manager] - Changes issue #11 label to `approved` → It becomes ready for Worker Agent (no action from me)
2026-02-05 22:17:18 [INFO] [product-manager]
