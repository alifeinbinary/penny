Excellent! I've completed my batch processing work:

## Summary of Work Completed

### Processed Issues
✅ **Issue #11: Reaction-Based Feedback** (idea → draft)
- Researched and wrote comprehensive specification
- Outlined 3-phase implementation approach (logging → adaptation → export)
- Identified technical dependencies and risks
- Added open questions for user feedback
- Updated label from `idea` to `draft`

### Current State
- **Backlog**: 20 issues waiting for user to promote to `idea`
- **Idea**: 0 issues (all processed!)
- **Draft**: 1 issue (#11, awaiting user review)
- **Approved**: 0 issues (none ready for development yet)

### Next Steps
The specification for reaction-based feedback is now awaiting user review. Once the user provides feedback or approves it (by changing the label to `approved`), I'll either:
- Iterate on the spec based on their comments, or
- Let it move to the Worker Agent for implementation

All current work is complete. I'll check back next cycle to see if:
1. User has promoted any backlog items to `idea` status
2. User has provided feedback on the draft spec for #11

Perfect! Here's what I found:

## Summary of Current State

- **0 issues with `idea` label** - nothing ready for me to expand
- **1 issue with `draft` label** - #11 "Reaction-Based Feedback" 
  - I posted the detailed spec on 2026-02-06 at 03:16:27Z
  - No user feedback yet (user hasn't commented)
  - Status: Waiting for user review
- **20 issues with `backlog` label** - not my responsibility to process (user hasn't selected these for expansion yet)
- **0 issues with `approved` label** - nothing ready for Worker Agent

## Action Taken

✅ **No work needed this cycle**

All `idea` issues have been processed (there are none). The one `draft` issue (#11) is awaiting user feedback, and I should not take action until the user responds. The backlog issues are intentionally waiting for user to promote them to `idea` status.

## Next Steps

I'll check back on the next cycle. When the user:
- Promotes any `backlog` issue to `idea` → I'll research and write a detailed spec
- Comments on issue #11 with feedback → I'll respond with an updated spec
- Changes issue #11 label to `approved` → It becomes ready for Worker Agent (no action from me)

**Batch processing complete.** No issues required PM action this cycle. Exiting cleanly. 🎯

Perfect! I can see the full picture now:

## Summary of Current State

**Total Open Issues**: 30
- **1 `draft`** (#11 - Reaction-Based Feedback) - Just updated with revised spec based on user feedback ✅
- **29 `backlog`** - Waiting for user to promote to `idea`
- **0 `idea`** - Nothing ready for me to expand
- **0 `approved`** - Nothing ready for development
- **0 `in-progress`** - No active development

## Work Completed This Cycle

✅ **Issue #11 (Reaction-Based Feedback)**: 
- Reviewed user feedback requesting reactions to keep threads alive for followup
- Posted updated specification with simplified approach:
  - Reactions as lightweight messages (`is_reaction` boolean in MessageLog)
  - No separate table needed, reuses existing thread structure
  - FollowupAgent treats reaction-children as valid continuations
- Waiting for user approval

## Next Steps

All `idea` and `draft` issues have been processed. The backlog contains 29 ideas waiting for the user to promote them to `idea` status. My work for this cycle is complete.

The user can now:
1. Review the updated spec for issue #11 and either approve it (change label to `approved`) or provide more feedback
2. Promote any `backlog` issues to `idea` if they want me to expand them next cycle

Exiting cleanly until next run. 🚀

Perfect! I have a complete picture of the current state:

## Summary of PM Work Completed

✅ **Issue #11 (Reaction-Based Feedback)** - Successfully moved from `draft` to `approved`
- User provided clarifying feedback on the spec
- I updated the specification to match their vision (reactions as lightweight messages that keep threads alive)
- User approved and requested label change
- Label updated to `approved` - ready for Worker Agent to implement

📋 **Current State**:
- **0 `idea` issues** - nothing ready for me to expand
- **1 `approved` issue** (#11) - ready for Worker Agent
- **20 `backlog` issues** - waiting for user selection, I should not work on these until promoted to `idea`

All work is complete for this cycle. The backlog items are properly in the backlog state awaiting user prioritization. Issue #11 has been successfully transitioned through the workflow and is now ready for implementation.

The PM cycle is complete - no `idea` issues to expand, no `draft` issues with pending feedback to process. Ready to exit until next cycle. 🚀
