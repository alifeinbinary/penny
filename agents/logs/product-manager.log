Excellent! I've completed my batch processing work:

## Summary of Work Completed

### Processed Issues
✅ **Issue #11: Reaction-Based Feedback** (idea → draft)
- Researched and wrote comprehensive specification
- Outlined 3-phase implementation approach (logging → adaptation → export)
- Identified technical dependencies and risks
- Added open questions for user feedback
- Updated label from `idea` to `draft`

### Current State
- **Backlog**: 20 issues waiting for user to promote to `idea`
- **Idea**: 0 issues (all processed!)
- **Draft**: 1 issue (#11, awaiting user review)
- **Approved**: 0 issues (none ready for development yet)

### Next Steps
The specification for reaction-based feedback is now awaiting user review. Once the user provides feedback or approves it (by changing the label to `approved`), I'll either:
- Iterate on the spec based on their comments, or
- Let it move to the Worker Agent for implementation

All current work is complete. I'll check back next cycle to see if:
1. User has promoted any backlog items to `idea` status
2. User has provided feedback on the draft spec for #11

Perfect! Here's what I found:

## Summary of Current State

- **0 issues with `idea` label** - nothing ready for me to expand
- **1 issue with `draft` label** - #11 "Reaction-Based Feedback" 
  - I posted the detailed spec on 2026-02-06 at 03:16:27Z
  - No user feedback yet (user hasn't commented)
  - Status: Waiting for user review
- **20 issues with `backlog` label** - not my responsibility to process (user hasn't selected these for expansion yet)
- **0 issues with `approved` label** - nothing ready for Worker Agent

## Action Taken

✅ **No work needed this cycle**

All `idea` issues have been processed (there are none). The one `draft` issue (#11) is awaiting user feedback, and I should not take action until the user responds. The backlog issues are intentionally waiting for user to promote them to `idea` status.

## Next Steps

I'll check back on the next cycle. When the user:
- Promotes any `backlog` issue to `idea` → I'll research and write a detailed spec
- Comments on issue #11 with feedback → I'll respond with an updated spec
- Changes issue #11 label to `approved` → It becomes ready for Worker Agent (no action from me)

**Batch processing complete.** No issues required PM action this cycle. Exiting cleanly. 🎯

Perfect! I can see the full picture now:

## Summary of Current State

**Total Open Issues**: 30
- **1 `draft`** (#11 - Reaction-Based Feedback) - Just updated with revised spec based on user feedback ✅
- **29 `backlog`** - Waiting for user to promote to `idea`
- **0 `idea`** - Nothing ready for me to expand
- **0 `approved`** - Nothing ready for development
- **0 `in-progress`** - No active development

## Work Completed This Cycle

✅ **Issue #11 (Reaction-Based Feedback)**: 
- Reviewed user feedback requesting reactions to keep threads alive for followup
- Posted updated specification with simplified approach:
  - Reactions as lightweight messages (`is_reaction` boolean in MessageLog)
  - No separate table needed, reuses existing thread structure
  - FollowupAgent treats reaction-children as valid continuations
- Waiting for user approval

## Next Steps

All `idea` and `draft` issues have been processed. The backlog contains 29 ideas waiting for the user to promote them to `idea` status. My work for this cycle is complete.

The user can now:
1. Review the updated spec for issue #11 and either approve it (change label to `approved`) or provide more feedback
2. Promote any `backlog` issues to `idea` if they want me to expand them next cycle

Exiting cleanly until next run. 🚀

Perfect! I have a complete picture of the current state:

## Summary of PM Work Completed

✅ **Issue #11 (Reaction-Based Feedback)** - Successfully moved from `draft` to `approved`
- User provided clarifying feedback on the spec
- I updated the specification to match their vision (reactions as lightweight messages that keep threads alive)
- User approved and requested label change
- Label updated to `approved` - ready for Worker Agent to implement

📋 **Current State**:
- **0 `idea` issues** - nothing ready for me to expand
- **1 `approved` issue** (#11) - ready for Worker Agent
- **20 `backlog` issues** - waiting for user selection, I should not work on these until promoted to `idea`

All work is complete for this cycle. The backlog items are properly in the backlog state awaiting user prioritization. Issue #11 has been successfully transitioned through the workflow and is now ready for implementation.

The PM cycle is complete - no `idea` issues to expand, no `draft` issues with pending feedback to process. Ready to exit until next cycle. 🚀

Great! I can see the current state of GitHub Issues:

- **0 issues** with `idea` label (nothing ready for me to expand)
- **0 issues** with `draft` label (no specs awaiting user feedback)
- **20 issues** with `backlog` label (waiting for user to promote)

Since there are no `idea` or `draft` issues to process, there's no work for me to do right now. All existing issues are in `backlog` state, which means they're waiting for the user to select which ones they want me to research and expand.

## Summary

✅ **Processed `idea` issues**: 0 found  
✅ **Processed `draft` issues**: 0 found  
📋 **Backlog items**: 20 items waiting for user selection

The Product Manager agent is idle and waiting for the user to:
1. Change labels from `backlog` → `idea` on issues they want expanded
2. Provide feedback on any `draft` specs (none exist currently)

I'll check back next cycle (in 1 hour) to see if any issues have been promoted to `idea` status. Until then, there's nothing for me to process autonomously.

The backlog includes interesting ideas like:
- ReminderAgent (#3)
- TrendingAgent (#4) 
- DigestAgent (#5)
- FactCheckAgent (#6)

Good! I can see the current state:

**Summary:**
- 📋 **0 issues with `idea` label** - No work ready for me to expand
- 📝 **0 issues with `draft` label** - No specs awaiting user feedback
- 🗂️ **20 issues with `backlog` label** - Unvetted ideas waiting for user selection

Since there are no `idea` or `draft` issues to process, my work here is complete for this cycle. All the issues are currently in `backlog` state, which means the user hasn't yet selected which ones they want me to research and expand.

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Checked for `idea` issues to expand → None found
- ✅ Checked for `draft` issues with user feedback → None found
- ✅ Observed 20 backlog items → Waiting for user to promote to `idea`

**Backlog Overview** (for awareness):
The backlog contains various feature ideas across several categories:
- **Platform Expansion**: Slack (#16), Telegram (#17), Email (#19), Matrix (#18)
- **Content Features**: Bookmark System (#13), Knowledge Base (#14), Quote Library (#15)
- **Intelligence**: Cross-User Learning (#21), Semantic Search (#22), Memory Layers (#23), Conversation Analytics (#20)
- **User Experience**: Group Features (#24), Quiet Hours (#25), Priority System (#26), Explain Mode (#27)
- **Technical**: A/B Testing (#28), Performance Metrics (#29)
- **Fun**: Personality Modes (#30), Game/Quiz Features (#31), Easter Eggs (#32)

No action required from me at this time. The next step is for the user to review the backlog and promote items to `idea` status when they're ready for me to research and flesh them out. 🚀

Perfect! I can see the current state:

- **32 issues in backlog** - waiting for user to promote to `idea`
- **1 issue approved** (#11 Reaction-Based Feedback) - ready for Worker Agent
- **0 issues with `idea` label** - nothing for me to expand right now
- **0 issues with `draft` label** - nothing awaiting user feedback

## Summary

✅ **No work to process this cycle**

All issues are currently in `backlog` status, meaning they haven't been promoted by the user yet. According to the workflow:

> **Label: `backlog` - Unvetted Ideas**  
> Your job: **DO NOTHING** - wait for user to promote to `idea`

The one `approved` issue (#11 Reaction-Based Feedback) is ready for a Worker Agent to implement, not for me to touch.

**Next Steps:**
- When the user promotes any issue from `backlog` to `idea`, I'll automatically expand it with a detailed specification
- The user can promote issues by running: `/opt/homebrew/bin/gh issue edit <number> --remove-label backlog --add-label idea`

I'll check again on the next cycle. 🚀
